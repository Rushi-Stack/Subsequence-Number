# Subsequence-Number

A subsequence of an array is a set of numbers that aren't necessarily adjacent
in the array but that are in the same order as they appear in the array. For
instance, the numbers [1, 3, 4]  form a subsequence of the array [1, 2, 3, 4]
and so do the numbers [2, 4].
Note that a single number in an array and the array itself are both valid
subsequences of the array.



# Time Complexity and Space Complexity
o(n) is the time complexity of program and 0(1) is space complexity of program n is the length of element
